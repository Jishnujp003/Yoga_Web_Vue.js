        <h1>Nadi Shuddhi Pranayama</h1>
        <p>Nadis are subtle energy channels in the human body that can get blocked due to various reasons. The Nadi Shodhan pranayama is a breathing technique that helps clear these blocked energy channels, thus calming the mind. This technique is also known as Anulom Vilom pranayama.</p>
        <ul style= "list-style-type: circle; ">Blocks in nadis
                <li>Nadis can get blocked on account of stress</li>
                <li>Toxicity in the physical body also leads to blockage of nadis</li>
                <li>Nadis can get blocked due to physical and mental trauma</li>
                <li>Unhealthy lifestyle</li>
            </ul>

            <ul style= "list-style-type: upper-roman; ">Steps
                <li>Sit comfortably with your spine erect and shoulders relaxed. Keep a gentle smile on your face.</li>
                <li>Place your left hand on the left knee, and palms open to the sky or in Chin Mudra (thumb and index finger gently touching at the tips).</li>
                <li>Place the tip of the index finger and middle finger of the right hand in between the eyebrows, the ring finger and little finger on the left nostril, and the thumb on the right nostril. We will use the ring finger and little finger to open or close the left nostril and thumb for the right nostril.</li>
                <li>Press your thumb down on the right nostril and breathe out gently through the left nostril.</li>
                <li>Now breathe in from the left nostril and then press the left nostril gently with the ring finger and little finger. Removing the right thumb from the right nostril, breathe out from the right.</li>
                <li>Breathe in from the right nostril and exhale from the left. You have now completed one round of Nadi Shodhan pranayama. Continue inhaling and exhaling from alternate nostrils.</li>
                <li>Complete 9 such rounds by alternately breathing through both the nostrils. After every exhalation, remember to breathe in from the same nostril from which you exhaled. Keep your eyes closed throughout and continue taking long, deep, smooth breaths without any force or effort.</li>
