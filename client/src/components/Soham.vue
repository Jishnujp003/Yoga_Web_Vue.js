  <h1>Soham Meditation</h1>
  <p class="b">A well-trained, stable, and focused mind is an asset in every sphere of life, and essential for any
    spiritual endeavor. The practice below will develop your concentration, clarity, and inner stability, by providing a
    single object as the resting place for your mind’s awareness—the universal mantra so'ham. Practice daily at about the
    same time, starting with 10 minutes, and gradually increasing to 20–30 minutes, or longer.</p>

  <p class="b">Step 1. Begin by training your body to be still and comfortable in a sitting posture. When the spine is
    erect with the pelvis, chest, and head vertically aligned, the breath becomes smooth, and the mind alert and relaxed.
    Sit on a chair, or cross-legged on the floor with a cushion or a folded blanket under the hips. Use enough support to
    lift the hip joints slightly higher than the knees. This minimizes the effort needed to keep the lower back from
    rounding.<br>
    <br><br>Step 2. Close your eyes and mentally draw a circle of light around yourself. The circle separates you from the
    world of daily life—both the outer world of perceptions and activities, and the world of your familiar preoccupations
  and thinking patterns. With this intention, see yourself sitting inside this circle of light. It delineates a space in
  which you can contain your awareness; let it protect you from disturbances, distractions, and mental dissipation.
</p>
<p class="c">Feel the entire body sitting comfortably still, release any unnecessary tension, and pay attention to the
  movement of the breath.</p>
<p class="b">Step 3. Feel the entire body sitting comfortably still, release any unnecessary tension, and pay attention
  to the movement of the breath. Refine your awareness as you feel the breath become smoother and more subtle, expanding
  from the solar plexus into the limbs on the inhalation, and releasing back to the solar plexus on the exhalation. Be
  aware of the touch of the breath everywhere in the body.
  <br><br>Step 4. Making sure the body and breath stay relaxed, focus your attention at each of the following energy
  centers, moving systematically through the body and inhaling and exhaling once at each point: eyebrow center · throat
  center · right shoulder · right elbow · right wrist · each of the right fingertips, starting with the thumb · right
  wrist · right elbow · right shoulder · throat center · left shoulder · left elbow · left wrist · each of the left
  fingertips, starting with the thumb · left wrist · left elbow · left shoulder · throat center · heart center · navel
  center · center of the pelvis · pelvic floor · center of the pelvis · navel center · heart center · throat center ·
  eyebrow center.
</p>
<p class="c">The breath is subtle and slow, so let your concentration be fine and sensitive, becoming more and more
  one-pointed, and gradually drawing deeper into the mind. Rest in this awareness as long as you like.</p>
<p class="b">Step 5. Now rest your attention at the eyebrow center. Feel the ebb and flow of the breath through the
  inner space of the whole body, while maintaining your focus on the eyebrow center. Sense the vibration of a slow wave
  of breath. This vibration is the mantra so'ham (pronounced so-hum). Hear the sound so on the inhale, and the sound ham
  on the exhale. The breath is subtle and slow, so let your concentration be fine and sensitive, becoming more and more
  one-pointed, and gradually drawing deeper into the mind. Rest in this awareness as long as you like.
  <br><br>To finish the practice, gradually return your awareness to the flow of the breath in the body, the physical
  presence of the body, and the space around you. Remain aware of the breath and your inner connection as you release
  the body from your sitting posture. You may want to open your eyes into the palms of your hands, massage your face,
  and stretch your arms and legs before getting up.
