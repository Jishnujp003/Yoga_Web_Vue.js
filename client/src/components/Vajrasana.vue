        <h1>Vajrasana [Diamond Pose]</h1>
        <p>Vajrasana pose is a simple sitting yoga pose. Its name comes from the Sanskrit word vajra, which means
            thunderbolt or diamond.

            For this pose, you kneel and then sit back on your legs to take the weight off your knees. Breathing and
            meditative exercises are often done in this position, which is said to help your body become as strong as a
            diamond.</p>

                    <li>Start by kneeling on the floor. Consider using a yoga mat for comfort.</li>
                    <li>Pull your knees and ankles together and point your feet in line with your legs. The bottoms of your
                        feet should face upward with your big toes touching.</li>
                    <li>Exhale as you sit back on your legs. Your buttocks will rest on your heels and your thighs will rest
                        on your calves.</li>
                    <li>Put your hands on your thighs and adjust your pelvis slightly backward and forward until youâ€™re
                        comfortable.</li>
                    <li>Breathe in and out slowly as you position yourself to sit up straight by straightening your spine.
                        Use your head to pull your body upward and press your tailbone toward the floor.</li>
                    <li>Straighten your head to gaze forward with your chin parallel to the floor. Position your hands palms
                        down on your thighs with your arms relaxed.</li>
